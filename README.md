# Eye-Gaze-Controlled-Wheelchair
This project aimed at restoring mobility for ALS patients, allows wheelchair navigation through eye movements. Using a monocular camera, Dlib, and OpenCV, we developed a system that tracks gaze direction and translates it into precise motion commands. The bot emulates an eye-controlled wheelchair, combining affordability with ease of use.
